# Simple Linear Regression
[Linear regression](http://onlinestatbook.com/2/regression/intro.html) tries to fit a model in the form of a line to a set of data.  In the case of simple linear regression there is one independent and one dependent variable, resulting in the equation of a line 
```
y = ax + b
```
where _a_ is the slope and _b_ is the y-intercept.  

To run the R script install the following package at the R interpreter
```R
# install library containing graphing tools
install.packages("ggplot2")
```
