# Classification Trees
[Classification trees](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decision_tree_learning) use data to build a tree like predictive model to make predictions on a target variable.  The example scripts use a dataset consisting of customer data to determine if they will subscribe a term deposit.  

To run the scripts the following libraries/packages will need to be installed:    
Open the R interpreter and type
```R
# package for creating classification and regression trees
install.packages("tree")

# package consisting of tools for model fitting
install.packages("gmodels")
```  
For the Python script, type the following at the command line
```bash
# install library containing machine learning tools
pip install sklearn
```
