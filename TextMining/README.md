# Text Mining

[Text mining](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Text_mining) is used to find word frequency distributions.
This can be helpful in finding patterns that can be used for making predictions.

The following Python libraries are useful for creating word clouds to visualize word frequency distributions:
```shell
pip install wordcloud
```

For R, install the below packages:
```r
install.packages('tm')
install.packages('SnowballC')
install.packages('wordcloud')
```
